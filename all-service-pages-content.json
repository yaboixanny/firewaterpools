            "question": "How long does leak detection take?",

            "question": "Should I drain my pool when I leave for the season?",
            "answer": "No. Draining a pool in Florida can cause the shell to pop out of the ground due to hydrostatic pressure from groundwater. Keep your pool filled and maintained, even when you're away."

            "question": "How often should someone check on my pool while I'm gone?",
            "answer": "For Florida summers, we recommend at least bi-weekly visits to maintain chemistry, run equipment, and catch any issues early. Monthly is a minimum, but problems can develop quickly in our climate."

          {
            "question": "What caused my pool to turn green?",
